# Among us decentralized

C++ Qt

crossplateform

a little proof-of-concept que Qt est adapté: faire un "personnage" qui se déplace sur "un fond"

- map/persons (assets from native game for instance) - https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio
- menu (main menu and "meetings")
- network: peer-to-peer with secret (visibility) - using OpenSSL/Helib for cryptography
- tasks

- vocal chat during "meetings" (not priority)
- extra anti cheat (not priority)

realtime game similar to (C++ Qt decentralized...) https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/Travian-blockchained

-----------

knowing approximatively what number of pixels per second a user can walk is necessary for anti-cheat also (and making users walk at the same speed)
https://among-us.fandom.com/wiki/Player_speed - not very useful

make some tests (by a human for tasks for instance but precise a procedure)
