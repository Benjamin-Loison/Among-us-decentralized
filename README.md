# Among us decentralized
Among Us

C++ Qt or SDL2

crossplatform

a little proof-of-concept que Qt est adapté: faire un "personnage" qui se déplace sur "un fond"

- map/persons (assets from native game for instance) - https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio
- menu (main menu and "meetings")
- network: peer-to-peer with secret (visibility) - using OpenSSL for cryptography
- "mini-games"

- vocal chat during "meetings" (not priority)
- extra anti cheat (not priority)

realtime game similar to (C++ Qt decentralized...) https://github.com/Benjamin-Loison/Travian-blockchained

-----------

could make a foxhole like too or something similar (view from top on 2D scene) but not really known, likewise we already got assets for Among Us project

next week: deeper presentation
