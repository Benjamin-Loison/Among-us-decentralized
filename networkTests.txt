Assume all peers connecting to others using IPs that every peer can use to access to all other peers
Prefer local networks to global one so: localhost > LAN > WAN
These tests checked that all users see all users with the right colors and when one move all others see this one move
No test on the long run only "initialization" here
Pay attention to precise IPs because implictly it's localhost and don't forget to open ports or accept software network in firewall
Could a bit assume that if works with all network combinaisons with 3 peers it works in general because all connection method would be tested
Having better than Anydesk to enable playing in LAN while in WAN would be nice
All tests were performed twice

Localhost:

A start
B -> A
C -> A

Works

Localhost:

A start
B -> A
C -> B

Works

LAN:

Indexes are used to distinguish computers
In my case:
0: My laptop (Mint)
1: My server (Debian)
2: Family's laptop (Windows)

A0 start
B0 -> A0
C1 -> A0

Works

LAN:

A0 start
B1 -> A0
C1 -> A0

Works

LAN:

A0 start
B1 -> A0
C1 -> B1

Works

LAN:

A0 start
B1 -> A0
C2 -> A0

2 not able to connect to 0 (time out) while having the correct IP and port - restarting 0 and 2 solved the problem (only 0 is the problem ?)
Works

LAN:

A0 start
B1 -> A0
C2 -> B1

Works

No WAN test could be performed because Orange Livebox 4 port forwarding isn't working correctly anymore even if no conflict with workaround with DMZ

WAN:
