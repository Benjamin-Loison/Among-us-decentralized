Assume all peers connecting to others using IPs that every peer can use to access to all other peers
Prefer local networks to global one so: localhost > LAN > WAN
These tests checked that all users see all users with the right colors and when one move all others see this one move
No test on the long run only "initialization" here
Pay attention to precise IPs because implictly it's localhost and don't forget to open ports or accept software network in firewall
Could a bit assume that if works with all network combinaisons with 3 peers it works in general because all connection method would be tested
Having better than Anydesk to enable playing in LAN while in WAN would be nice
All tests were performed twice

Localhost:

A starts
B -> A
C -> A

Works

Localhost:

A starts
B -> A
C -> B

Works

---------

LAN:

Indexes are used to distinguish computers
In my case:
0: My laptop (Mint)
1: My server (Debian)
2: Family's laptop (Windows)
3: My computer (Windows)
4: Mum's laptop (Mint)

A0 starts
B0 -> A0
C1 -> A0

Works

LAN:

A0 starts
B1 -> A0
C1 -> A0

Works

LAN:

A0 starts
B1 -> A0
C1 -> B1

Works

LAN:

A0 starts
B1 -> A0
C2 -> A0

2 not able to connect to 0 (time out) while having the correct IP and port - restarting 0 and 2 solved the problem (only the received (0 here) is the problem ?)
Works

LAN:

A0 starts
B1 -> A0
C2 -> B1

Works

LAN:

E4 starts
D3 -> E4
B1 -> E4
C2 -> E4

Works perfectly

---------

WAN:

Assume port 10821 from external IPv4 from common network of A0 and B1 redirects to B1 on port 10821

B1 starts
A0 -> B1

WAN with port forwarding:

Assume B1 has access to a remote computer which has his port 10821 being opened

B1 starts
B1 runs: ssh -R 10821:localhost:10821 lemnoslife.com
A0 -> B1 (using lemnoslife.com)
