\begin{frame}{This Week --- Project swapping}
    Four enhancements of the initial Among Us project:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add a map
        
        \only<2>{
            Difficulties:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Manually creating the collision mask was long and tiring task.
                \item Tasks', vents' and doors' positions were hardcoded. Didn't have the time to modularize it, so used a boolean switch.
                \item Added a window to choose the map.
                \item Had to ensure that all players are on the same map, so had to modify the server to propagate the choice made by the first player.
            \end{itemize}
        
        
        }
        
        \item Add animations for players
        
        \only<3>{
            Problems:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Differences with how the frames are made
                \item Only the player associated with the instance called the proper functions
            \end{itemize}
        }
        
        \item Add a task (canon)
        
        \item Allow people from distinct LANs to play altogether
        
        \only<5>{Three possibilities:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Modify the client to manually route the packets
            \item Write a wrapper in order to display an interface for each peer
            \item Change the static routes of the computers involved
        \end{itemize}
        }
    \end{itemize}

Three Different Phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple Rust Game Server(successful): learn Rust-lang and use it to implement the early version of game server by following our early specification about communication protocol.
\item Final Rust Game Server(failed): try to mimic the go-version of minimal-server by rust-lang but eventually failed through long time trials
\item New Cannon Task(successful): implement an independent simple cannon game and integrate it with the latest version of AmongUsDecentralized game.
\end{itemize}
